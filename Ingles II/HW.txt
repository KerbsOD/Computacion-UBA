“In science it often happens that scientists say, 'You know that's a really good argument; my position is mistaken,' and
then they would actually change their minds and you never hear that old view from them again. They really do it. It
doesn't happen as often as it should, because scientists are human and change is sometimes painful. But it happens every
day. I cannot recall the last time something like that happened in politics or religion.”

I really liked this quote because i often think in this way when i see people defending their religion or political ideas without taking a step back and trying to understand another point of view. I really think that as a society we really need to approach the logical side of things. It's often seen that people have great emotion and pride concerning their beliefs. Don't like it very much. I do think that human beings need to be more rational about life. 
Although this is not easy. You can't tell people to ignore 100% their biases, i can't ignore mi bias. I'm always concerned about this, what if i'm not being rational and just emotional about something that will lead to a non good outcome? Just for pride.
We've seen this in history. How politics and religion killed thousends because of ideas, racism, hate speech; Destroyed lives, families, friendships. I don't like to talk about politics or religion with friends, it leads to discord.
The magic about logical thinking is cooperation, you can't admit you're right unless you have proof and the same happens to your counterpart. Leaving pride aside we can find the truth and bond. This is awesome.
